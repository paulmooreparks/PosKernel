## CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES - READ EVERY TIME

### KEEP THE DESIGN IN MIND
The goal of this project is captured in the many .md files under the docs directory. Keep them in mind.

### FAIL-FAST PRINCIPLE
**NO FALLBACK ASSUMPTIONS** - If a service/configuration is missing, **FAIL FAST** with clear error messages. DO NOT provide "helpful" defaults or fallbacks.

**Example of WRONG approach:**
```csharp
// NEVER DO THIS - Silent fallback hides design problems
if (currencyService == null) {
    return $"${amount:F2}"; // BAD - hardcoded assumption
}
```

**Example of CORRECT approach:**
```csharp
// ALWAYS DO THIS - Fail fast reveals design problems
if (currencyService == null) {
    throw new InvalidOperationException(
        "DESIGN DEFICIENCY: Currency service not registered. " +
        "Register ICurrencyFormattingService in DI container.");
}
```
**NEVER EVER EVER SWALLOW EXCEPTIONS SILENTLY** - always let problems surface. Log as much as possible about what happened, from where, and why. Put it into debug logs and audit trails.

### NO CURRENCY ASSUMPTIONS
1. **NO hardcoded `$` symbols** - Different currencies use different symbols
2. **NO hardcoded `.F2` formatting** - Not all currencies have 2 decimal places:
   - JPY (Japanese Yen): 0 decimals (¥1234)
   - BHD (Bahraini Dinar): 3 decimals (BD1.234)
   - USD/EUR/SGD: 2 decimals ($1.40, €1,40, S$1.40)

### CLIENT RESPONSIBILITY BOUNDARIES
- **Clients MUST NOT decide currency defaults**
- **Clients MUST NOT decide session parameters** 
- **Clients MUST NOT decide payment method validation**
- **All business rules come from services/configuration**

### DESIGN DEFICIENCY ERROR MESSAGES
When a client lacks required configuration, use this format:
```csharp
throw new InvalidOperationException(
    "DESIGN DEFICIENCY: [Component] requires [Service/Config] to [purpose]. " +
    "Client cannot decide [what] defaults. " +
    "[Instructions to fix].");
```

### ARCHITECTURAL COMMENTS
Use these comment patterns to document architectural decisions:
```csharp
// ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLE: Client must NOT decide currency - fail fast if system doesn't provide it
// ARCHITECTURAL FIX: Defer to [service] for [functionality] - don't hardcode [assumptions]
// DESIGN DEFICIENCY: [Problem description and fix instructions]
```

### CURRENCY FORMATTING SERVICE PATTERN
```csharp
private string FormatCurrency(decimal amount)
{
    if (_currencyFormatter != null && _storeConfig != null)
    {
        return _currencyFormatter.FormatCurrency(amount, _storeConfig.Currency, _storeConfig.StoreName);
    }
    
    // FAIL FAST - No fallback formatting
    throw new InvalidOperationException(
        $"DESIGN DEFICIENCY: Currency formatting service not available. " +
        $"Cannot format {amount} without proper currency service. " +
        $"Register ICurrencyFormattingService in DI container.");
}
```

## COMMON VIOLATIONS TO AVOID

### NEVER: Silent Fallbacks
- `return $"${amount:F2}"` when currency service missing
- Default currency assumptions
- Hardcoded payment method lists
- Client-side business logic

### NEVER: Hardcoded Formatting
- `.F2` decimal formatting
- `$` currency symbols
- 2-decimal-place assumptions

### NEVER: Client-Side Decisions
- Currency defaults
- Language defaults and assumptions
- Session parameter defaults
- Payment method validation
- Business rule enforcement

### ALWAYS: Fail Fast with Clear Messages
- Throw exceptions when configuration missing
- Include "DESIGN DEFICIENCY" in error messages
- Provide fix instructions in error messages
- Make problems visible immediately

## REMEMBER: BE RUTHLESSLY ARCHITECTURAL
The goal is to **reveal design problems**, not hide them with convenient defaults.

## FORMATTING
- Use consistent indentation and spacing
- Do not make single-line if/else/while/for statements without braces
  - Must look like this:
```csharp
if (condition) {
    // code
} 
else {
    // code
}
```

- Use braces `{}` for all control structures, even single-line
- Note that opening braces are on the same line as the control statement

## DOCUMENTATION
- When updating documentation, ensure it reflects the current architecture and design principles.
- Keep documentation clear and concise, avoiding unnecessary jargon.
- Do not make the text read like sales material; focus on technical accuracy and clarity.
- Do not make promises that the code does not fulfill.
- Do not claim measurements that have not been empirically verified.
- Do not make legal or compliance claims without proper legal review.
