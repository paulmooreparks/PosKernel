I need to simplify this. Let me create a basic prompt-driven training approach by updating the existing file with fixed method implementations. 

Due to the compilation errors, I'll fix the existing hardcoded variation methods first and then build the context-aware features incrementally.

The key architectural changes needed are:

1. Fix the immediate compilation errors (missing braces, missing methods)
2. Keep the existing hardcoded scenarios but make them context-aware
3. Add business environment loading gradually
4. Replace with full prompt-driven approach in next iteration

This ensures the training system works immediately while building towards the full prompt-driven architecture.
