## Architecture Compliance Achievements

### Currency Neutrality âœ…
**Major Achievement**: Eliminated all hardcoded currency assumptions

- **Solution Implemented**: Currency-aware helper functions query kernel via `pk_get_currency_decimal_places()`
- **Result**: Proper support for SGD (2 decimals), JPY (0 decimals), BHD (3 decimals)

### Audit Compliance âœ…
**Major Achievement**: Full reversing entry pattern implementation

- **Void Operations**: `pk_void_line_item()` creates negative quantity entries
- **Audit Trail**: Operator ID, reason codes, timestamps preserved

- **Recovery Support**: Write-ahead logging enables transaction recovery

### Fail-Fast Architecture âœ…
**Major Achievement**: No silent fallbacks or helpful defaults

- **Error Handling**: Clear "DESIGN DEFICIENCY" messages when services missing
- **Configuration Validation**: All services must be properly registered
- **Boundary Enforcement**: Clear failures when architectural boundaries crossed

## AI Integration Enhancements
