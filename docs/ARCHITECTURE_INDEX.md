## Architecture Compliance Achievements

### Culture Neutrality âœ…
**Major Achievement**: Eliminated all cultural assumptions throughout the entire stack

**Kernel Layer**:
```rust
// Rust kernel accepts client-provided currency information
fn new(code: &str, decimal_places: u8) -> Result<Self, &'static str> {
    Ok(Currency { code: code.to_uppercase(), decimal_places })
}
```

**Service Layer**:
```csharp
// C# services fail fast when cultural information not available
private string FormatCurrency(decimal amount) {
    if (_currencyFormatter != null && _storeConfig != null) {
        return _currencyFormatter.FormatCurrency(amount, _storeConfig.Currency, _storeConfig.StoreName);
    }
    throw new InvalidOperationException("DESIGN DEFICIENCY: Currency formatting service not available...");
}
```

### Memory Safety âœ…
**Major Achievement**: Comprehensive safety documentation for all FFI operations

```rust
/// # Safety
/// The caller must ensure that:
/// - `store_ptr` points to valid memory containing a UTF-8 encoded store name
/// - `currency_decimal_places` specifies the decimal places for currency (user-space decision)
/// - All pointers remain valid for the duration of this call
#[no_mangle]
pub unsafe extern "C" fn pk_begin_transaction(...)
```

### Fail-Fast Architecture âœ…
**Major Achievement**: No silent fallbacks anywhere in the system

- **Error Handling**: Clear "DESIGN DEFICIENCY" messages when services missing
- **Configuration Validation**: All services must be properly registered
- **Boundary Enforcement**: Clear failures when architectural boundaries crossed
